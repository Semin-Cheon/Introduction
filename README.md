# Welcome to visit my github page!

- Host: Semin Cheon. MD/Ph.D integrated course in KAIST Physics department 
- Laboratory: MDAIL-KAIST (http://mdail.kaist.ac.kr/index.html)
- I'm interested in LTEM, AET and Developing algorithms via MATLAB.

      Related about LTEM, I've been developing aligning algorithm for defocus series of HR-LTEM 
      images (and success! you can convince that with the results from my one of the github categories named "Aligning_Defocus_series").
        and i'm also developing TIE solving algorithms.
        
      Relted about AET, currently, I've been working on synthesizing Fe3O4 Supraparticles.

# To visitors (2022.03.08 ~ 2023.08.22)
Because of my duty of miltary service as Korean army, it would be hard to feed-back to your comments until 2023.08.22.
Even if that so, it would be slow, but i will keep update my history as possible i can.
